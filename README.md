# GEM Collector Game
Welcome to Gem Collector! You have been given the title of Master Gem Collector. At the beginning of each collection, the Geode Extraction Machine (G.E.M.) will extract crystals from geodes and will output a specific weight value. Your mission will be to match G.E.M.'s weight by adding your own crystals to your scale. 

## What is this?

This is a simple match game where you have to try and match the computers score by pressing buttons(crystals) that have been assigned a hidden number at random. Using addition, you must figure out the value of each crystal and then try to click the right combination to match the computer score. If you go over, you lose and the game resets with new hidden values. If you match the score, you win and the game resets as well

## How to Play:

- Click on any of the crystals to begin the game
- the hidden value of your crystal will be added to your total score.
-continue to click other crystals to try to bring your score closer to the computer's score.
